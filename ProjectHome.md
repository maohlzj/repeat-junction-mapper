Repeat Junction Mapper (RJMapper) is a software tool to automatically improve sequence assembly by using Repeat Junction Markers (RJMs). With the input of a known LTR retrotransposon database, a query dataset that contains unanchored sequences and a reference dataset, RJMapper links sequences by walking through three modules: (1) locating unique LTR RJMs in the query dataset, (2) mapping query sequences to reference sequences using shared unique LTR RJMs, and (3) anchoring unmapped query sequences to reference sequences using LTR RJM pairing information.
